# The primary objective of this project is to devise an innovative authentication system capable of thwarting unauthorized access to user IDs and secret keys, thus mitigating the risks posed by various hacking methods. At the core of this system lies the imperative to promptly alert unauthorized users attempting to utilize specific user IDs, thereby curtailing their access and safeguarding users' sensitive information from potential breaches. To accomplish this goal, the system harnesses the OAuth technique for authentication purposes, augmented by the utilization of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for user identification. Functioning as a Prediction control model, fueled by the Text Davinci Algorithm, the system dynamically adapts its operations with each user login event. Serving as an interactive interface, it seamlessly addresses user queries and concerns, operating akin to a Help Desk and providing instantaneous clarification whenever doubts arise. In instances where breaches in user security are detected, a robust security protocol is swiftly set into motion. The system implements pattern keys as a pivotal security measure, enabling the unique identification of users. Unlike traditional static passwords, these pattern keys generate fresh secret codes upon each user access attempt, significantly enhancing the system's resistance to unauthorized intrusion. By doing this, it gets beyond the OAuth security layer, which allows for user hacking with the right secret key but is impossible here. Crucially, these pattern keys are securely embedded within a software system model inaccessible to unauthorized entities. This ensures that even if malicious actors were to obtain the correct secret key, they would be unable to breach the system's fortified defenses. Through the adoption of this multifaceted approach, the system reinforces its security measures, instilling greater confidence among users in the reliability and integrity of the authentication process.
